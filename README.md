<!-- Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms. -->

The project consists of three functions:

- A fibonacci sequence generator which creates a list of numbers inline with the fibonacci sequence starting from `[1, 2]`.
- A function which takes in the generated fibonacci sequence generated by the previous function and returns a new list containing only the even values of the generated sequence up to 4 million.
- A function which returns an integer that is the sum of every value within the list created previously that is even and less than 4 million.

To run the project, type `python __main__.py` into the console when in the even_fibonacci_nums directory.

To autoformat python files run `pipenv run black *.py`.
